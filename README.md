About my skill
I’m an entry-level Python developer with a strong interest in data processing and automation.
After graduating in Electrical Engineering, I started learning Python to automate reporting tasks at my first job.

I’ve built small ETL scripts, written a few API wrappers, and currently experimenting with Flask to understand how backends work.

Always curious, always experimenting — hoping to grow into a full-stack or backend role one step at a time.
